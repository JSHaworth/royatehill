                [More detailed information about the history, location, or ethos of the allotments could go here. This section is currently a placeholder.]
                Coombe Brook Valley Allotments provides a valuable green space for local residents to grow their own produce and connect with nature.

        <section id="resources">
            <h2>Useful Resources</h2>
            <p>The site is aspiring to be organic, we aim to stay away from chemicals and practices that are harmful to wildlife. In fact, we actively encourage wildlife around our crops.</p>
            <p>There is a compost loo and a drinking water tap on the Community Orchard (more on this below). There's also a noticeboard there, please check it for news, and feel free to use it too for allotment-relevant communication.</p>
            <p>There are piles of compost and wood chip at the end of the lane (by the viaduct). The compost is £1/barrow. Please do pay, either via Paypal (QR code on white board by the compost) or directly to Mike Williams or Mike Feingold. The wood chip is free.</p>
            <p>Children are welcome on site, as allotments are such a great way to learn about growing food and nature; however, we ask that they stay supervised and respect the other plots and their tenants' privacy. Dogs must be held or tethered on a lead.</p>

            <h3>Community Orchard</h3>
            <p>The Community Orchard is a great place to get involved, learn about (permaculture) growing and meet fellow volunteers. There's a work day every Saturday of the month (12-4pm ish). Follow the Orchard on Facebook to get the latest news (<a href="https://www.facebook.com/royatehill" target="_blank">https://www.facebook.com/royatehill</a>).</p>

            <h3>Administration</h3>
            <p>You might have received these 2 documents: 'Do's and Don'ts' and 'Tenants handbook'. Please read those carefully to get to know the expectations, rules & regulations linked with having an allotment tenancy.</p>
            <p>It's worth knowing that if you're in receipt of certain benefits, you can apply online for a 50% Benefits Discount on your rent. You'll need to apply between 1st July and 1st August each year.</p>
            <p>Please keep a clear sign with your plot number by the entrance of your plot. Also, don't wait too long before getting stuck with your plot, as there is an expectation that you will start cultivating within three months (if you don't do this, you can lose the plot).</p>

            <h3>Future of Royate Hill Allotments</h3>
            <p>Plot-holders, co-workers and helpers of Royate Hill have started discussions on how we could self organise creatively to have a collective voice for the site. If you want to be part of the conversation, you can join the WhatsApp group or email <a href="mailto:coombebrookvalley@gmail.com">coombebrookvalley@gmail.com</a>.</p>
